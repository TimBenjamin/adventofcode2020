# Advent of Code, 2020

My solutions for this year's AoC. I am using Go as a way of learning Go.

## Progress:
- Day 1: very nice + big success (got tempted to over-engineer)
- Day 2: very nice + big success (with a regexp-shaped hammer, every problem is a regexp-shaped nail)
- Day 3: very nice + big success (tried out the various ways of declaring slices / arrays)
- Day 4: very nice + big success (match those patterns!)
- Day 5: very nice + big success (round and round we go, this could be more efficient...)
- Day 6: very nice + big success (could do with refactoring...)
- Day 7: very nice + big success (I will need a Bag of Holding by the end of this)
- Day 8: very nice + big success (enjoyable program error correction, which makes a pleasant change)
- Day 9: very nice + big success (seemed suspiciously straightforward today - is there something encrypted in the data???)
- Day 10: very nice + big success, eventually (part 2 was difficult and I had many false starts)
- Day 11: 
- Day 12: 
- Day 13: 
- Day 14: 
- Day 15: 
- Day 16: 
- Day 17:
